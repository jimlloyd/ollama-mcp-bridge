   - Unified service management interface
   - Platform-specific implementations isolated

2. **Reliability**
   - Health check-based service monitoring
   - Graceful service lifecycle management
   - Improved error handling
   - Better recovery mechanisms

3. **Maintainability**
   - Clean architecture
   - Well-defined interfaces
   - Comprehensive tests
   - Clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed API documentation
   - Create platform-specific setup guides
   - Document configuration options

2. **Testing**
   - Add more edge case tests
   - Improve platform-specific test coverage
   - Add performance tests

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Add support for additional platforms
   - Enhance monitoring capabilities
   - Add metrics collection

## Migration Guide

1. **For Existing Code**
   ```typescript
   // Old approach
   await forceKillOllama();
   const process = exec('ollama serve');

   // New approach
   const serviceManager = createServiceManager(config);
   await serviceManager.startService();
   ```

2. **Configuration Updates**
   ```typescript
   // Add to bridge_config.json
   {
     "service": {
       "port": 11434,
       "healthCheck": {
         "timeout": 30000,
         "interval": 1000
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   ```typescript
   try {
     await serviceManager.startService();
   } catch (error) {
     if (error instanceof ServiceError) {
       // Handle service-specific errors
     }
   }
   ```

## Conclusion

The refactoring has successfully:
1. Removed Windows-specific process management complexity
2. Improved cross-platform compatibility
3. Enhanced reliability and maintainability
4. Added proper service lifecycle management

The new implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements while maintaining clean architecture principles.
